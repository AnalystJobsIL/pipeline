# Backlog — what is known-wrong and not yet fixed

Everything here is **durable**: a design debt or a known gap that outlives any one session.
Current-state items ("what broke last night", "what to watch tomorrow") belong in
`HANDOFF.md`, not here; dated narrative belongs in `docs/sessions/`.

Moved out of `HANDOFF.md` §4c/§4d verbatim on 2026-08-23 by the `docs` lane. Each item names
the lane that would own the fix (see `docs/AGENT_BRIEF.md` for the lane table). Nothing here
is claimed — if you take one, say so in `HANDOFF.md`.

## From the ten-agent audit, 2026-08-22

**Known and NOT fixed — the ranked backlog:**
1. `pipeline/ats.py` registry: adding an ATS platform still touches ~22 sites in 14 files;
   `platform_check` reports the gaps but the consolidation itself is the real fix.
2. Relative-date parsing exists in 5 places with different capabilities (none handle
   "week"/"hour"; SerpApi dates never normalize at all).
3. `_REQ_HEADER` in `seniority.py` is dead code — `_desc_is_ml`'s docstring claims it reads
   the requirements section but it uses `_ROLE_START`, which lands on boilerplate 22% of the
   time and cuts the requirements past the 1400-char LLM window.
4. `metrics.jsonl` (one JSON line per run) would answer "is coverage growing / did a source
   die / did the classifier stop working" — none of which is answerable today.
5. Company aliases: `Meta`+`Meta Israel`, `IBM`+`IBM Israel`, `Port`+`Port.io` are separate
   active rows scraping the same board.
6. `mark_sent` records intent, not delivery — a relay failure burns roles as sent.

## Infra inputs from the firmographics workstream

*(was `HANDOFF.md` §4d, first of the two sections that carried that number)*

What building §7 (and three adversarial-review waves over it) revealed about the
infrastructure itself. Complements the ten-agent audit backlog above; ordered by leverage.

1. **One state layer, not two.** The local/cloud split (`state/` vs `cloud_state/`) forced
   every firmographics consumer to care *which* seen.db it reads, and open item 7 exists
   because sqlite binaries can't git-merge. Direction: keep sqlite as a per-machine cache
   and make the *committed* artifact a text export per table (JSON/JSONL — diffable,
   row-mergeable with the `merge_csv_rows.py` pattern), or move shared state off git
   entirely. Whatever the choice, "who owns which table" should be declared in one place.
2. **Retire `companies.csv` as a database.** 20 writers, a state machine encoded in prose
   verdict strings, six allowlist pools that must be updated in sync (the documented #1 bug
   class), plus literal duplicate rows (Datadog/MongoDB/Elastic twice) and alias rows
   (Meta/Meta Israel — audit item 5 above). A registry table with an explicit state enum +
   transition log would delete the entire "verdict-string rule" hazard category.
3. **One identity layer.** `_norm_company` existed but nothing used it for keys — that gap
   alone produced 9 double-researched companies and 3 wasted run.py budget slots per digest.
   Normalized identity (plus an explicit alias map for the Meta/Meta-Israel class) should be
   THE key in every store, join, and dedupe — not a per-consumer patch, which is what the
   firmographics fixes are today.
4. **A single automation inventory.** Jobs now live in three schedulers: GitHub Actions
   crons, the Windows scheduled task (`IsraeliJobs-Firmographics`, 6-hourly), and whatever a
   session runs by hand. Nothing lists all three; ARCHITECTURE.md section 4 covers only CI. One table
   (owner, trigger, machine, quota it spends, state it writes) is a prerequisite for making
   anything "less messy" — you can't simplify what you can't enumerate.
5. **Design away the Windows-automation traps instead of re-fixing them per script:** cp1252
   stdout under redirection (three scripts crashed on Hebrew names before
   `sys.stdout.reconfigure`; mandate `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` at every entrypoint), cmd/
   PowerShell quoting for detached launches (an inline `Start-Process` argument string
   failed silently; committed `.cmd` wrappers work), unbuffered `-u` for anything logging to
   a file, and **git + sqlite inside OneDrive** — sync races with live db writes are an
   incident waiting; consider excluding `state/` from sync or moving the repo out.
6. **Consolidate root-script sprawl.** 40+ root scripts, several executing on import (no
   `__main__` guard), each hand-rolling its own arg parsing, secrets loading, store opening,
   and now UTF-8/retry boilerplate. A `python -m pipeline <command>` CLI with shared
   bootstrap would shrink the surface the next audit has to re-verify.
7. **Unified quota ledger.** LLM calls are spent from four sites (role judgments, blurbs,
   firmographics research, employee fills) plus Bright Data credits and SerpApi — each with
   its own caps and none metered centrally. Extending the `metrics.jsonl` idea above with
   per-source spend counters per run would make "what does a day of this system cost" and
   "what just burned the quota" answerable.
8. **One backoff/retry store.** The same gating machinery now exists twice
   (`cloud_state/resolve_attempts.json` for self-heal; `firmo_failed` + retry-day constants
   for firmographics) with different semantics (weekly/5-strikes vs weekly/monthly). A
   generic attempts table (key, kind, strikes, last, next-eligible) would serve both and
   whatever comes next.
9. **Validate discovery output at the source.** Job titles leak into company names ("Sql
   developer - X", "my team", "AppSec") and then every downstream layer needs its own guard
   (`looks_like_junk` is a patch, not a fix). The discovery bridge should validate/reject
   company fields before anything enters `research_companies.json` or `matched`.
10. **Let company-death knowledge flow back.** Firmographics research keeps discovering
    defunct/absorbed companies (Alike Health, Syte, Sckipio, SimilarTech, NanoLock, Rewire
    R&D) but that knowledge dies in a JSON field — rows stay active and keep being fetched.
    A small review queue proposing `defunct:` parking from firmographics evidence closes
    the loop.

## Honest state of the infrastructure — READ BEFORE ADDING ANYTHING

*(was `HANDOFF.md` §4d, second of the two sections that carried that number)*

**It is sprawling, and that is the top thing to fix next.** Numbers, not adjectives:
67 root scripts, 10 workflows, 27 root scripts invoked by a workflow (re-counted
2026-08-23 — it said 62/19), and **23 separate tools whose job
is "work out where a company's jobs live"**:

    auto_expand  resolve_llm  resolve_deep  resolve_broken  resolve_any  resolve_parallel
    resolve_unknowns  listing_hunt  deep_validate  crack_walled  audit_empty_rows
    validate_empty  validate_bd  recheck_suspects  wayback_rescue  bd_rescue
    retry_unreachable  scan_dead_domains  triage_dark  repair_extract_gap  probe_ats
    detect_ats  comeet_resolve

Each was a rational response to one concrete failure (a bot-walled ATS, a dead domain, a
JS-only page, a stale URL). Together they overlap heavily, share four near-duplicate
detection tables, and are individually cheap but collectively hard to reason about. Nobody
designed this shape; it accreted in a day.

**What is genuinely load-bearing** (touch these first, ignore the rest until you must):
`pipeline/` (run, fetchers, seniority, israel, store, digest, health, verdicts,
aggregators, atomic), `scrape_universal.py`, `auto_expand.py`, `listing_hunt.py`,
`triage_dark.py`, `discovery_daily.py`, `discovery_telegram.py`, `refresh_scrape_cache.py`,
`enrich_scrape_jd.py`, `probe_candidates.py`, `check_invariants.py`, `merge_csv_rows.py`.

**Legacy / one-shot / superseded** — this list has moved to `docs/MODULES.md`, which
classifies every root module and is enforced by `docs/check_docs.py` (a new root script
with no entry there fails the test suite). Two names on the original list were wrong:
`ingest_research` is imported by `retry_unreachable.py`, which runs daily at 02:30, and it
in turn imports `probe_ats` for `slug_variants` — deleting either breaks a scheduled
workflow. That is precisely the "imported for their regex tables" hazard, so the registry
records the importer for every legacy module rather than the adjective.

### The consolidation plan, in order

1. **`pipeline/ats.py` platform registry.** One frozen dataclass per platform (host regex,
   detection patterns, endpoint builder, fetcher, flags). Derive `FETCHERS`, `ATS_HOST`,
   `SIGS`, `ATS_PATTERNS`, `_HTML_ATS`, the `resolve_llm` prompt table + enum, and the
   `empty-board` exemption from it. Adding a platform becomes one literal instead of ~22
   edit sites in 14 files. `pipeline/platform_check.py` already reports the gaps — use it as
   the regression harness, and rewrite it to assert against the registry rather than grep.
2. **Collapse the 23 resolvers into one ladder with pluggable strategies.** They already
   form a de-facto ladder (deterministic → LLM → render+sniff → listing-hunt → unlocker);
   make that explicit, with each strategy a function and the triage mode selecting which to
   run. `triage_dark.py` is the right seam — it already classifies; the resolvers should be
   its handlers.
3. **`pipeline/dates.py`** — five relative-date parsers today, none handling "week"/"hour",
   and SerpApi dates never normalize at all.
4. **`pipeline/jdtext.py`** — `_ROLE_START` / `_ROLE_MARKER` / `_REQ_HEADER` / `_REQ_HARD`
   are four vocabularies for "where does the role text start". `_REQ_HEADER` is dead code,
   and `_desc_is_ml`'s docstring describes behaviour it does not have. Measured: the digest
   copy finds a requirements header in 21% of JDs where the classifier copy does not, which
   is why the LLM often never sees the requirements section.
5. **`metrics.jsonl`** — one line per run (rows, active, scanned, failed, empty, paths,
   by_source). Nine counters are already computed and thrown away in `run.py`. Without it
   nobody can answer "is coverage growing" or "did a source die" — Indeed silently returned
   zero for five days and nothing noticed.
6. **Company aliases** — `Meta`+`Meta Israel`, `IBM`+`IBM Israel`, `Port`+`Port.io` are
   separate active rows scraping the same board.
7. **Concurrency** — five workflows share `repo-state`; long jobs queue for hours and
   superseded runs are recorded as `cancelled` with zero output (happened twice today).
   Either shard the group or shorten the long jobs.
